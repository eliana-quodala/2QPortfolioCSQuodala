    <h3>about him ! ꉂ(˵˃ ᗜ ˂˵)</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Levi Ackerman is referred to as humanity’s strongest soldier in the Attack on Titan universe !</p>
      <p>He appears cold and distant, very strict with his subordinates and colleagues. This leads to the premonition that he despises most of his fellow soldiers.</p>
      <p> However, this is mostly due to his own PTSD and implied depression, he's afraid of getting too close with his comrades since most of his friends are already dead. </p>
      <p>He's 5'2 in height, a result of his malnourishment in his childhood years. He's also a heavily implied germaphobe, also a result of his childhood, since he was born in the lowest social hierarchy in the Walls.</p>
      <p> Despite that, his lineage was well-respected, until his time where they started discriminating against the Ackermans.</p>
      <p> The Ackermans were experimented on, leading to increased body strength and were made to be the bodyguards of the Royal Family. However, they were treated like robots, and with most of their sour attitudes and robot-like personalities, eventually hunted down.</p>
